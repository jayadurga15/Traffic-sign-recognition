# Traffic-sign-recognition
Here's the updated README in one paragraph:

This project focuses on traffic sign classification using machine learning models and includes two files: `GUI_Traffic_Sign_Classification.py`, a Python script for traffic sign classification, and `Traffic_Sign_Recognition.ipynb`, a Jupyter notebook for traffic sign recognition. The project can be executed using PyCharm or any Python IDE by opening the Python script or the notebook. For the Jupyter notebook, open it in Jupyter or a compatible IDE like VSCode and run all cells. The dataset for traffic sign classification can be downloaded from Kaggle via the following link: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign)
